class PyPoly:
    """
    
    A class that uses methods from other classes to set up and run the game PyPoly.

    Attributes: 
    - list_of_players: A list that contains our player_instances
    - property_locations: A dictionary whose key is a tuple that contains the location of our Property which is our value.
    - win_requirement: An integer that will store our winning condition/requirement
    - ongoing: A boolean that represents whether the game is ongoing or not 

    Behaviours:
    - validate_range_input: Prompts the user to type a value that is within the range, if the value is not within the range, it will keep on prompting until it is.
    - ai_thinking: This function is responsible for printing out that the AI is thinking, it handles generating a random delay to generate suspense.
    - pre_start_game: Essentially asks for the number of players, player names, winning condition and what data it should use.
    - regular_player_turn: This function is responsible for playing a normal player's turn
    - ai_player_turn: This function is responsible for playing an AIPlayer's turn, very similar to regular_player_turn but the options are chosen automatically by the AIPlayer.
