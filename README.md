# PyPoly ðŸ’°

## Introduction

PyPoly is a text-based board game inspired by Monopoly, developed using advanced Python concepts. Unlike traditional Monopoly, the goal in PyPoly is to be the first player to purchase a certain number of properties of the same color group and build at least one hotel on each of those properties. Players also have unique move traits, adding a strategic layer to their movement around the game board.

## Features

### 1. Property Management

- **Property Creation**: Properties are categorized into color groups (Blue, Green, Red, Yellow) with attributes like name, cost, hotel cost, rent price, and ownership status.
- **Hotel Construction**: Players can build hotels on their properties to increase rent. A maximum of two hotels can be built per property.

### 2. Player Management

- **Player Attributes**: Players have names, symbols, funds, move traits, positions, and owned properties.
- **Fund Management**: Methods to add or reduce funds based on game events.
- **Property Transactions**: Players can purchase, sell properties, and build hotels if they have sufficient funds.

### 3. Game Board

- **Board Setup**: The game board is an n x n grid with properties and chance grids (penalty/reward).
- **Player Movement**: Players move based on their chosen trait (perpendicular, diagonal, or L-shaped moves).

### 4. AI Player

- **AI Strategy**: AI players make strategic decisions based on property ownership and available funds.
- **Automated Moves**: AI players automatically choose the best move and decide on property transactions.

### 5. Game Dynamics

- **Random Start**: Players start at random positions on the board with an initial fund of $150.
- **Chance Grids**: Landing on a chance grid can result in penalties or rewards.
- **Rent Payments**: Players pay rent when landing on properties owned by other players, with rent increasing by 20% per hotel built.

### 6. Winning Condition

- **Victory Criteria**: The first player to purchase the target number of properties of the same color group and build at least one hotel on each wins the game.
